You'reAgo is an app where users can register with their email/pass or log in with their Google account via Firebase authentication and start journaling their day, track their emotions and things they are grateful for. Entries are saved in firestore. Entries will then be emailed to you a year after. App is built with Next.js.

# Highly recommend not using the deployed app just yet besides for just checking things out, I will be able to see your entries.

## Getting Started
```
1) Clone repo and create ".env.local" file in root client and follow ".env.example" format and fill it out with your own firebase credentials

Enjoy!
```

## Coming Soon
1) Encrypting entry contents so only the user can see their entries
2) Dashboard where users can see their stats, days journalled and other metrics
3) Nodemailer set up so emails actually get sent
4) Settings where users can select to be emailed in a year, 6 months, or 3 months and change their email address
